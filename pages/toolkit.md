# Toolkit

The **Heterogeneous Agents Resources and toolKit (HARK)** is the first framework released under Econ-ARK.

## Installation

### Download and Install Anaconda

Go to [https://www.anaconda.com/download/](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) and download Anaconda for your operating system; be sure to get the version for Python 2.7.

Follow the [instructions](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) if required to install Anaconda.

### Add extra packages (optional)

If you want to use HARK’s multithreading feature, you need to add two packages that aren’t part of the default Anaconda distribution. Simply open a command prompt and type the following, accepting defaults to install:

    conda install joblib

    conda install dill

## Hark

### Overview

HARK aims to produce an open source repository of highly modular, easily interoperable code for solving, simulating, and estimating dynamic economic models with heterogeneous agents.

### Download HARK

[Download HARK](https://github.com/econ-ark/HARK/archive/master.zip) from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/econ-ark/HARK).

Unpack the HARK.zip file using any archive utility, like Peazip. Put the files anywhere you’d like, maintaining the internal directory structure.

Alternatively you can clone the repository using Git:

    git clone https://github.com/econ-ark/HARK.git

### Run Spyder

Open a command prompt and do spyder. Spyder is an interactive development environment (IDE) for iPython, a slightly prettier, more interactive flavor of Python.

### Open a HARK module

Go to the directory where you put HARK and open any file with the .py extension; we recommend /ConsumptionSaving/ConsIndShockModel.py.

### Run the module

Click on the green arrow "play" button toward the right side of the toolbar of icons at the top of the Spyder window (accept defaults if a dialogue box pops up).

Congratulations! HARK is now up and running on your computer.

You can find further instructions in the [HARK User Manual](https://github.com/econ-ark/HARK/raw/master/Documentation/HARKmanual.pdf).
