## Welcome to the Econ-ARK Project

The Econ-ARK project provides open-source toolkits for researchers trying to understand how economic and social outcomes result from the actions of heterogeneous individuals. The primary goals of the project are to make entry into the world of such modeling easy; to accelerate the development of this kind of modeling for policy-making and academic research; and to increase the openness, replicability, and interoperability of modeling tools.

Econ-Ark is headed by [Christopher D. Carroll](http://www.econ2.jhu.edu/people/ccarroll/), Professor of Economics at the Johns Hopkins University. The project is a grant recipient from the [Sloan foundation](https://sloan.org/), and is under the umbrella of projects with fiscal sponsorship by [NumFocus](https://www.numfocus.org/).
